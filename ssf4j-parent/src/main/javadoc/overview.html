<h1>Simple Serialization Facade for Java</h1>

Simple Serialization Facade for Java (SSF4J) is a library for use when developing other libraries.
Often it is necessary for a library to persist data that it may not have full knowledge
of during development; SSF4J allows the user of a library to supply to the library the appropriate
serialization system for the objects being processed.
